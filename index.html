            Itachi Uchiha was initially one of the <br />
            antagonists of the Shonen Jump Manga and<br />Anime series Naruto
            and older brother to<br />
            the deuteragonist Sasuke Uchiha. It is <br />
            then revealed, later in the series, <br />
            that Itachi's actions were <br />
            for the greater good.

            Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku <br />Uchiha.
            His early childhood was marked with violence <br />due to the rough
            ways of the Uchiha. Itachi later <br />
            became an international criminal and joined the <br />
            Akatsuki, a criminal organization which consists <br />of Shinobi
            that exist outside of the usual <br />system of the hidden village.

            From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable
            maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every
            situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was
            a rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor
            underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and
            accurate.

        >
          <div>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 190px">
              A pacifist at heart, Itachi did not actually like fighting and
              would avoid it when he could. As such, he preferred to rely on
              Genjutsu as a first option, ending fights with as little damage as
              possible. When he couldn't avoid actual combat, he would end the
              fight as quickly as he could, all the while holding back as much
              as possible.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            Being so accomplished as a ninja enabled Itachi to approach problems
            less violently than others would, satisfying his peace-loving
            nature. These two extremes of his personality came into conflict as
            events moved toward the Uchiha Clan Downfall; he did not want to
            harm his family and sought a peaceful resolution, but knew that the
            path with the least bloodshed would be the clan's extermination.
            When the Uchiha Clan refused to deter from their plans, Itachi was
            pushed over the edge and his normally polite attitude to his
            clansmen became more violent, criticising them openly and lashing
            out at them for the choices that sealed their fates and his own.
            Despite this, at his heart, Itachi truly hated what he had to do for
            sake of preserving peace, trembling with hesitation as he prepared
            to kill his parents and crying upon doing it. With Izumi, valuing
            her companionship, and aware of her feelings for him, Itachi opted
            to put Izumi under a powerful Tsukuyomi to allow her to live the
            life she'd always dreamed with him, allowing her death to be quick
            and peaceful.
